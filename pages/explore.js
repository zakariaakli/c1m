The ideal distance, especially in places where air conditioning <br></br> can help spread aerosolised particles, is between 3 to 4 meters. If you find it necessary, contact the person in charge the <br></br> day before to remind them that the area should be clear or unoccupied.</p>
          <p style = {{marginLeft : 50}}><strong>2 -</strong> To avoid contamination and being infected, wear nitrile gloves while performing repairs. Never wear gloves larger than <br></br>your own size, as the looseness in the wrist area will compromise your safety. </p>
          <p style = {{marginLeft : 50}}><strong>3 -</strong> When you leave, always disinfect your hands before you drive again. Repeat these precautions throughout all dayâ€™s work. </p>
          <p style = {{marginLeft : 50}}><strong>4 -</strong> dismiss all greetings and handshakes </p>
